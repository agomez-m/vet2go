            Your furry companion must have a microchip and a valid rabies
            vaccination. The rabies shot should have been administered at least
            21 days prior to your appointment with the veterinarian who will
            issue the Animal Health Certificate (AHC). You will need to provide
            documentation as evidence of the rabies vaccination. It's not
            mandatory for the same vet who issues the AHC to administer the
            rabies vaccine; any licensed veterinarian can do it. Proof of rabies
            vaccination can be in the form of a vaccination card, a certificate,
            an old pet passport, or your pet's complete medical history from
            your regular veterinarian. For details on the types of documents we
            accept as proof of rabies vaccination, please refer to our dedicated
            page. While not obligatory, it's advisable to keep your pet's
            routine annual vaccinations up to date even for travel within the
            EU.

            Different veterinarians follow varying procedures and timeframes
            when issuing Animal Health Certificates. However, all vets are
            required to observe a 21-day waiting period following the rabies
            vaccination before they can issue an AHC, unless it's a booster
            rabies vaccination administered prior to the expiration of the
            previous one. At PassPets, we strive to simplify the process for
            you: 1. Confirm your pet meets the eligibility criteria - refer to
            the requirements above. 2. Schedule an appointment with us - this
            appointment should be booked at least 21 days after your pet's
            rabies vaccination and within 10 days of your intended travel date.
            3. Fill out our pre-appointment form, which will be sent to you via
            email. 4. Attend your appointment, and we will issue the AHC right
            then and there.

            If you're traveling with a dog directly to Ireland, Northern
            Ireland, Finland, Norway, or Malta, it's necessary to visit a UK
            veterinarian within 1 to 5 days (24 to 120 hours) before your
            scheduled arrival in the destination country. During this visit, the
            vet will administer tapeworm treatment and record it in the AHC. At
            PassPets, we can conveniently provide the tapeworm treatment and
            document it when we issue the AHC, given that your appointment falls
            within 1 to 5 days before your entry into Ireland, Northern Ireland,
            Finland, Norway, or Malta. ​ However, if you're traveling with a dog
            to any other EU country, you won't require any additional items
            besides the Animal Health Certificate. ​ If you're accompanying a
            cat or ferret, the AHC alone suffices, and no extra documentation is
            necessary.

            If you're traveling with dogs, you must visit a veterinarian in the
            EU within 1 to 5 days (24 to 120 hours) before your scheduled return
            to the UK. During this visit, the vet will administer tapeworm
            treatment and record it in the AHC. Upon your return to the UK,
            you'll be required to present the AHC with the recorded tapeworm
            treatment at the border. ​ However, this requirement doesn't apply
            if you're bringing back dogs directly from Ireland, Northern
            Ireland, Finland, Norway, or Malta since they would have already
            received tapeworm treatment before departing. ​ For cats or ferrets,
            there are no additional requirements for returning to the UK. You'll
            only need to present the Animal Health Certificate at the border
            upon your return. For more detailed information, please refer to our

            Once the Animal Health Certificate is issued, you have a window of
            10 days to begin your trip. ​ The certificate remains valid for 4
            months, allowing onward travel within the EU, or until the rabies
            vaccination's expiration date, whichever occurs earlier. However, if
            you leave the EU, such as returning to the UK, you will require
            another AHC to re-enter. For further details on the validity of
            Animal Health Certificates, please visit our dedicated page. It's
            important to note that your pet won't need a repeat rabies
            vaccination each time, as long as its vaccinations are kept up to
            date.

            If you won't be accompanying your pet during travel, you can still
            obtain an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) under specific conditions.
            To be eligible, you must plan to reunite with your pet within 5 days
            of their travel date. Depending on how your pet is traveling, here
            are the requirements: Pet Traveling Alone with a Pet Transport
            Company: If your pet is traveling independently with a pet transport
            company, you'll need to provide your vet with the transport
            company's details before scheduling the AHC appointment. Reuniting
            with your pet within 5 days of their departure is mandatory. The pet
            transport company must also carry documentation, such as a flight
            booking confirmation, to confirm this requirement. Pet Traveling
            with a Named Friend or Family Member: If your pet is traveling with
            a named friend or family member, you must provide the vet issuing
            the AHC with a written declaration, indicating your approval for the
            named person to travel with your pet. It's essential that you intend
            to reunite with your pet within 5 days of their departure. The named
            individual traveling with your pet must have documentation, such as
            a flight booking confirmation, to validate this requirement. If you
            won't be able to reunite with your pet within 5 days of their travel
            date or if the move involves a commercial transaction (e.g., change
            of ownership), you'll need an Export Health Certificate instead.
            Feel free to contact us for more information on this matter.

            The validity of rabies vaccinations can vary depending on factors
            such as the vaccine manufacturer and the country where it was
            administered. Here's the information regarding different scenarios:
            If your pet's rabies vaccination was administered using the Nobivac,
            Canigen, or Versiguard brand in the UK, it is valid for 3 years from
            the date of administration. If the brand used was Rabisin, it is
            typically valid for 1 year, unless it was given as a booster Rabisin
            rabies vaccination (given before the previous Rabisin vaccination
            had expired), in which case it is valid for 3 years. If your pet's
            rabies vaccination was administered in the EU, it is most likely
            valid for one year only, regardless of the brand used. If you're
            uncertain about the validity of your pet's rabies vaccination, I
            recommend contacting your veterinarian's practice, as they should
            have a record of it and can provide you with the necessary
            information.

            Health certificates encompass a range of certificates issued by
            veterinarians to confirm the fitness of an animal for travel. Here
            are the key distinctions: Animal Health Certificate (AHC): This
            certificate is specifically required for dogs, cats, or ferrets
            traveling to the EU on a non-commercial basis. Export Health
            Certificate: This certificate is necessary for dogs, cats, ferrets,
            and most other animals traveling outside the EU or to the EU for
            commercial purposes. Fit to Fly / Travel Certificate: Some airlines
            or travel companies may request this certificate to verify that a
            pet is in good health and suitable for travel. While the terms "dog
            health certificates," "cat health certificates," "pet health
            certificates," and "pet travel certificates" are used generally,
            they can refer to any of the certificates mentioned above, depending
            on the context and specific travel requirements.
